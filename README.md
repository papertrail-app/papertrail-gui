## System Dependencies

In addition to the Python modules outlined in `pyproject.toml`, in order to use this you'll need some system dependencies:

###### Windows:

On Windows, PaperTrail depends on `poppler` and `zbar`, but they have been bundled here and should work without anything extra both when running the Python module and when running the release executable.

###### Linux:

On Linux, install `zbar` and `poppler-utils` (or your distribution's equivalents). 

## License

PaperTrail is licensed under the **MIT** license.
